            Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data"

        From 'The Data Scientist's Toolbox' Series


Introduction
------------

The goal of Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course is to teach the 
concepts of tidy data.  The course project requires students to manipulate
data from a study of smartphone movement measurements and create one tidy data
file.  The original data is provided in several files.

See the Readme.md file in this github for details about the R script
used to create the output.

This codebook describes the 2 output files of the run_analysis.R script.


A definition of a tidy data set from   https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing :

   1. Each variable you measure should be in one column
   2. Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
   3. There should be one table for each "kind" of variable
   4. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows 
      them to be linked


The smartphone study web site:

   http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data for the project was downloaded from this site:

   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 



Tidy Data File #1
------------------

tidy_samsung.txt

This file is the result of merging the source data files into one data frame

Its dimensions are 10,299 rows by 69 columns.  

Per the tidy data definition above, each row represents one observation and each
column represents one variable.


Columns:

1. Subject 

   Extracted from the  /train/subject_train.txt  and  /test/subject_test.txt  files.

   It represents the people who participated in this study.  The original data
   uses numbers 1 through 30, but I replaced them with names to make the 
   output more recognizable.  The data remains anonymous.


2. Activity

   Extracted from the  /train/y_train.txt  and  /test/y_test.txt  files.

   The values 1 through 6 represent the movements that the participants 
   made while wearing the Samsung phones.

   The values have been converted from numbers to text using the values
   from the  activity_labels.txt  file:

      1 -> WALKING
      2 -> WALKING_UPSTAIRS
      3 -> WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
      4 -> SITTING
      5 -> STANDING
      6 -> LAYING


3. Type

   This column was added to preserve the origin of the row data in case
   future calculations need to take this into consideration.

      "train" - represents data from the  /train  files
      "test"  -      "       "    "   "   /test    " 


Note:  

Columns 4 through 69 represent the ones with the "mean" or "std" function 
names.

These were extracted from the  features.txt  file that which 561 variables.

To preserve the integrity of the original data, the names have not been 
modified except to remove parantheses and commas.  The reason is that 
while cryptic, these may closely match variables output by the Samsung
device.

Refer to the  features_info.txt  file for more details on the derivation
of these variables.  The text from that file is copied to the bottom of this
one for reference.


Unit values -- per the README.txt file in the original data:

   Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Tidy Data File #2
------------------

tidy_samsung_subset_means.txt


This file the output for step #5 in the assignment:

   Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
   each variable for each activity and each subject.


Its dimensions are 180 rows by 68 columns.  

The fewer rows are due to the subsetting of the data per the 
Activity and Subject variables.



Columns:

1. Activity

   Same as file #1.


2. Subject 

   Same as file #1.
   

Note:  

Columns 4 through 69 represent the ones with the "mean" or "std" function 
names.

They have the same names, but contain the calculated mean value for 
the subsetting computation.




Files from original experiment
-------------------------------

README.txt

   overall explanation of experiment


features_info.txt

   more explanatory text


features.txt - 561 rows, 1 colum

   This file contains 561 rows with the names of the test variables.
   Of these, 53 contain the word "mean"
             33 contain the word "std"

   These are the columns that need to be extracted.


activity_labels.txt - 6 rows, 1 column

   This file contains the 6 scenarios in which the Samsung smartphone accelerometer and
   gyroscope data was collected:

   1. walking
   2. walking upstairs
   3. walking downstairs
   4. sitting
   5. standing
   6. laying



There are 2 directories that contain more data.  

   training -
   test 


/test

y_test.txt - 2947 rows, 1 column

   Lists the activities (walking, sitting, etc.) associated with the next data file.

X_test.txt - 2947 rows, 561 columns

   Each row contains real numbers that represent data for each of the 561 data labels described in 
   features.txt.

subject_test.txt - 2947 rows, 1 column

   Each row represents one of the 9 people that was tested (30% of the total population of 30).
   For the test directory, these numbers are 
   2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, 24 

   /Intertial_Signals

      This looks like extremely raw data, and since none of the labels have descriptors such as
      "mean" or "std" that need to be extracted, I decided not to read these in.


      body_acc_x_test.txt  - 2947 rows, 128 columns
      body_acc_y_test.txt  - 2947 rows, 128 columns
      body_acc_z_test.txt  - 2947 rows, 128 columns

      body_gyro_x_test.txt - 2947 rows, 128 columns
      body_gyro_y_test.txt - 2947 rows, 128 columns
      body_gyro_z_test.txt - 2947 rows, 128 columns

      total_acc_x_test.txt - 2947 rows, 128 columns
      total_acc_y_test.txt - 2947 rows, 128 columns
      total_acc_z_test.txt - 2947 rows, 128 columns


/training

   Contains the same files as in /test, except these are for the 21 people who were "trained"

   However, the row count is greater:  7352.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals 
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity 
acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived 
in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using 
the Euclidean norm 

(tBodyAccMag, 
 tGravityAccMag, 
 tBodyAccJerkMag, 
 tBodyGyroMag, 
 tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals 
producing
 
   fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
   fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
   fBodyGyro-XYZ, 
   fBodyAccJerkMag, 
   fBodyGyroMag, 
   fBodyGyroJerkMag.    (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. 
These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
